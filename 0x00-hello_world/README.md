File 4-puts.c is a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

File 5-printf.c is a C program that prints exactly "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,", followed by a new line.

File 6-size.c is a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

File 100-intel is a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
