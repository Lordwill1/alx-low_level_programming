# PROJECT 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105258746/189934273-f596e713-d5a1-4ab2-b623-75094e5c9b0e.png)
#### Nested loop means a loop statement inside another loop statement. That is why nested loops are also called as “loop inside loop"
`(A nested loop is a loop inside the body of another loop)`

- Note: The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
~ You have to start by creating your `main.h` first. (The resources is below for your reference)

## ** File `main.h` is the header file containing all the function prototypes used in this project... >>>> THIS FILE IS VERY IMPORTANT

#### ==> File: `0-putchar.c` is a program that prints `-putchar`, followed by a new line.

#### ==> File: `1-alphabet.c` is a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

#### ==> File: `2-print_alphabet_x10.c` is a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

#### ==> File: `3-islower.c` is a function that checks for lowercase character.

#### ==> File: `4-isalpha.c` is a function that checks for alphabetic character.

#### ==> File `5-sign.c` is a function that prints the sign of a number.

#### ==> File `6-abs.c` is a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

#### ==> File `7-print_last_digit.c` is a function that prints the last digit of a number.

#### ==> File `8-24_hours.c` is a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

#### ==> File `10-add.c` is a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

#### ==> File `11-print_to_98.c` is a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
```
File: `_putchar.c` contains the _putchar() function definition.
```

## Advanced Task

#### ===> File `100-times_table.c` is a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.

#### ===> File `101-natural.c` is a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.

#### ===> File `102-fibonacci.c` is a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.

#### ===> File `103-fibonacci.c` is a program that finds and prints the sum of the even-valued terms of the Fibonacci suite under 4000000, followed by a new line.

#### ===> File `104-fibonacci.c` is a program that finds and prints the first 98 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
